I used guidra to analize the executable, showing me the decompiled code.
If you do that you will see a lot of things like:

basic_string<char,std--char_traits<char>,std--allocator<char>>

Which you don't see in a C++ code, instead trying to figure out what those
things are, try to look the string with the most human readable form.

The strings are:

"pass"
"Enter the password: "
"Nope"
"Welldone!"

From reading those strings, you see that maybe "pass" would be the password,
and indeed, it is.

"pass" is the password.

You don't need to look all the code to find the password.
An easier approach is to look directly to the strings that are generated by
the program instead using a software to decompile the executable.
Thx zsarge for that recommendation. :)
