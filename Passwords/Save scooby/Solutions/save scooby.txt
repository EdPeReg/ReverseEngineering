The idea here, it gets the full path of your current directory (that depends where 
you are executing the program).

It will change all '/' with '$' and change each character following the next conditions:
	1. If a lowercase letter is found, take that character and substract 30, this will
	   convert that character to uppercase but with two values more.

		* h = 104
		* J = 104 - 30.
	
	2. If an uppercase letter is found, convert it to lowercase adding 30.
		* D = 68
		* b = 68 + 30

After this you will have a path with the next form: $JQOG$bQEWOGVU

Now will check that each character from the user input matches with a character
from the path. If it match you got it :).

Example:

Path = /home/Documents
Path converted = $JQOG$bQEWOGPVU

Valid keys: $, $J, $JQ (Each character should match, $j is invalid).
